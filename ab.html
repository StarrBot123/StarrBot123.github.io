<font size="6"><b><u>Why StarrBot ?</u></b></font>
 <br><br>
There are multiple reason to choose StarrBot products.
 <br><br>
First is Convenience. Through StarrBot you can control all the electrical and electronics appliances in your Home. Be it your Lights, Fans, Refrigerator, Television, Door Lock, virtually anything. You will be able to control all your devices through the convenience of your mobile phone and voice control. (Give Examples) For example you are out of your home and then suddenly remember “Have I switched off the Geyser before coming out?” And then starts a series of phone calls and a period of torment which I think everyone has gone through at least once. Now, not anymore. Just open your app and check. If its on, turn it off. Also with the help of StarrBot’s Smart Sense your fan speed gets reduced automatically in chilly nights, lights come on when you enter a room, in fact even your porch and temple light can come on after dusk. You don’t even have to open the app. Its that simple and convenient.
 <br><br>
Second is Security. Again very important for your Home. Smart Sense which can double up as an Intrusion Detector can detect Intrusion and can alert you with notifications. Pressing on the “GoodBye” button before leaving will not only make sure that all your electrical devices are turned off but also trigger the Intrusion Detectors automatically. On top of this we have a Video Door Phone which has the capability to make a video call on your phone wherever you are every time someone comes at your door. You can speak to that person and if you have a Digital Lock, you can even open the door for the visitor. This Video Door Phone also has Motion Detectors on it to detect unscrupulous activities on your door step. We have our own Door Lock which not only can be opened remotely but also can sendyou notifications if in case it has been opened manually. We also integrate with Yale Door Lock who has a very aesthetic range of locks.
 <br><br>
Third is Energy Savings and Energy Monitoring. StarrBot converts your beautiful home to a smart energy efficient home. It will notify you about energy consumptions of all the rooms time to time. It will also make sure that if there is no occupancy in a room no heavy devices are switched on. It will alert you before a device meltdown as it is constantly monitoring the vital energy stats of the devices. Any anomaly is reported. You will also get a predictive billing every 15 days time helping you to save better.
 <br><br>
Last but not at all the least is the “WOW Factor”. With a premium automation product like StarrBot your Home will be like the Smartest Home of the block. Just imagine the shock your friends and family will be in, once they will hear you doing all these operations through your Voice and that too in your MOTHER TONGUE!! With StarrBot’s own indigenously designed and developed Voice Engine it can understand any language provided you specify the devices and rooms correctly.
 <br><br>
We have all the products that a Smart Home requires. Our Master Hub is one of the mandatory product which is basically the Heart of the System. It basically coordinates with all the end devices like Sensors and Switches. It has all major Wireless Interfaces like Wi-Fi, Zigbee and Bluetooth for interfacing with 3rd Party Devices. Our Server Tablet is also one of the mandatory product which completes the ecosystem. It is like the Brain of the system housing our AI Backbone and make sure the system runs flawlessly in Online and Offline Modes. Also it doubles up as an Interface for you and your Parents to use in your Home especially when you don’t want your Phone in sight. We have Switch Controllers which basically interface with your existing Tick-Tock switches and automate your connected appliances. We recommend normal robust switches essentially because no touch switch or panel can guarantee you the life that a robust normal switch can. We have an unparalleled replacement guarantee of 5 years which essentially means that you are contended for 5 years. These switch controllers which come in 4 variants (5,3,2,1) so that you don’t run out of options; also have unbuilt energy sensors which can measure the energy consumption of the appliances. 
 <br><br>
Our StarrBot Smart Sense has Motion, Light and Temperature Sensor all inbuilt into one giving you not only intelligent features like light and motion based light and fan control but also can act as an intrusion detector when you are away from your house. 
 <br><br>
Our StarrBot IR Blaster is responsible for Functional Control of any Infrared Remote Controlled appliance like TV, SetTop Box, DVD Player, Blue Ray Player, Projector, Air Conditioner etc. With the help of IR Blaster you can have access t 15 keys fo any remote that you have in that room. Because Infrared as a protocol operates only on Line Of Sight so the IR blaster can only control devices in the room it is in. The IR Blaster is a very powerful device and in a typical room it can act with ease without any positional constraint.
 <br><br>
Except for these devices we also have different kinds of peripheral controllers like Curtain Controller, Door Lock Controller, Water Sprinkler Controller, Gate Controller etc, in short our portfolio is “you name it we have it.” So we are a One Stop Shop for all your Smart Home needs.
 <br><br>
Coming to our USPs we are the only company giving a 5 years of unquestioned replacement guarantee. Our features are premium though we come under a very affordable segment. In consumer electronics or for that matter in any industry proper customer support is a major concerns amongst consumers. We have developed an infrastructure through which we can remotely trouble shoot what is the problem in your system. We can tell to the extent where the problem is and so our resolution time is the quickest. The only time anyone from our company has to visit your Home aster Installation is when there is a Hardware Damage which is very very rare. </h4>
